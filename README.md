# The Open Product Manifesto
In a world where technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, we believe the future of product development lies in openness, collaboration, and collective intelligence. We introduce Open Product – a new approach to building products that are not only open-source but open in every aspect: from design to development, and from iteration to distribution. The Open Product approach reimagines how products should be created, improved, and shared. It is driven by the conviction that open collaboration is the most powerful force for innovation.

## 1. Open by Design: Built to Be Shared
Every Open Product begins with the fundamental idea that the product’s core is designed to be transparent, accessible, and modifiable. We believe in openness as a principle that is woven into the fabric of the product itself. This means:
*	Open code: We use open-source software and tools to create our products, ensuring that anyone can see, modify, and contribute to the codebase.
*	Open documentation: Comprehensive documentation accompanies every Open Product, making it easy for new developers, designers, or users to engage and contribute to the ecosystem.
*	Open collaboration: Open Products invite collaboration from all over the world, empowering people with diverse perspectives to enhance the product and ensure its evolution is inclusive.

## 2. Community at the Core: Powered by Collaboration
At the heart of Open Products is a vibrant, engaged community. We reject the idea that products must be controlled by a central authority or a single company. Instead, we embrace a model where users and developers are co-creators in the product’s journey. This means:
*	Collective ownership: Open Products belong to the community. This ensures that no single entity can monopolize or restrict access to the product’s value.
*	Diverse voices: We encourage contributions from people of all backgrounds, ensuring the product reflects the needs and aspirations of a global audience.
*	Continuous feedback: Through open forums, issue trackers, and direct interactions, the product evolves based on real-world feedback, not just top-down decisions.

## 3. Transparency in Every Layer: Trust Through Openness
Trust is built through transparency. In an Open Product, every decision, change, and update is made visible to the public. This is not just about code, but about process, decisions, and future roadmaps. This includes:
*	Clear roadmaps: The product’s future is discussed openly with the community, allowing everyone to contribute ideas and vote on the most important features and priorities.
*	Inclusive decision-making: Decisions regarding the product’s direction, features, and governance are made through democratic processes, ensuring everyone’s voice can be heard.
*	Transparent progress: The development process is open and documented, so contributors can see the product’s growth in real-time, knowing where their contributions fit into the broader vision.
*	Transparent financials: Open Products may (like any) have costs.  Open Products that generate excess revenue will embrace crypto currencies and smart contracts to distrubute "profits" back to the community.

## 4. Sustainable and Ethical Innovation: Building for the Future
Open Products are not just about building technology; they’re about creating products that are sustainable and responsible. We advocate for products that respect the rights of users and the environment, and we strive to ensure that the products we create have a positive, lasting impact. This involves:
*	Ethical development: Every decision considers the ethical implications on users, developers, and the environment. We strive for inclusivity, privacy, and security.
*	Long-term sustainability: Open Products are designed to thrive in the long run. They are built on principles of sustainability, ensuring that they can adapt and grow over time, independent of any commercial interest.

## 5. Empowerment Through Access: Democratizing Technology
We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone. Open Products eliminate barriers to entry, providing anyone with the ability to access, use, and improve upon the product. This vision includes:
*	Free access to software: Open Products are free to use and share. We believe that access to the tools for innovation should be universal, removing the need for expensive licenses or subscriptions.
*	Open education: Through documentation, tutorials, and an open learning ecosystem, anyone can learn how the product works and how to contribute.
*	Access to the product’s full potential: Users can not only use the product but also customize it, fork it, or build on top of it, creating a more diverse ecosystem of innovation.

## 6. A New Paradigm: Shaping the Future Together
The Open Product movement is not just a shift in how we build products; it’s a rethinking of how we approach technology itself. It is about creating products that are not just tools, but ecosystems of innovation that anyone can be a part of. We are creating a future where technology is not something that is owned or controlled by a few, but something that belongs to everyone, everywhere.
By embracing openness, collaboration, and transparency, we open the door to a future where products evolve in alignment with the needs and aspirations of all people. Together, we can create a world where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.

## Join Us: The Open Product Movement
The Open Product is more than just a model for creating products—it is a call to action. We invite developers, designers, innovators, and users to join us in creating the future of products that are built for, by, and with everyone. Together, we can build technology that is truly open, ethical, sustainable, and empowering for all.
This is the future of product development. This is Open Product.
